System programming as opposed to application programming, is the activity of programming  system components or system software.

System programming in Python is done with the help of the 
sys and os modules.
they act as a middle layer of abstraction between the script and the operating system.

the os method allows
platform independent programming
 by providing 
abstract methods.


os.system can be used in linux to execute bash commands.
but system() doesn't return the optput of the shell command run.
for that we use 
x = os.popen(cmd)
the output stores in x can be read line by line.(probly a String)

os.rename,os.renames - for recursive creation of dirs to rename a file

os.mkdir,mkdirs - for recursive creation of dirs.

os.chdir - cd
os.getcwd - pwd
os.listdir - ls
