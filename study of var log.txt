Study of Var/log

the system logs and most application logs are located in the root/var/logs folder;

lsing into the folder one of the folders we find are the cups folder for external printers drives and requests, 

also a tool to directly view the sys logs can be using the dmesg tool

the format of the logs are as follows
[epoch time(probably] process/process description: log.
this can be written to and read using the -d or -n argument to dmesg (ref the bookmark htg in Btech propj folder)
